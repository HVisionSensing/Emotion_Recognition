\section{Results}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\noindent Different results are obtained based on the use of the Kinect or not.
\newline

\noindent The results obtained by using face images of the KDEF database as test set are quite good. The percentage of accuracy is of $ 66.67\% $. There is nevertheless one emotion that stands out because of its bad recognition accuracy. It is the \textit{sad} emotion. This emotion is mistaken mostly for the \textit{neutral} state. Indeed this two emotions are quite similar; almost identical. That is why the \textit{sad} emotion has this low accuracy.
\newline

\noindent The \textit{angry} emotion has also a bad recognition accuracy but it is not as significant as for the \textit{sad} emotion. The reason why is the same that for the \textit{sad} emotion. The \textit{angry} face distorts slightly more than the \textit{sad} face. The percentage of accuracy is thus of $ 41.67\% $ instead of $ 8.33\% $ for the \textit{sad} emotion.
\newline

\noindent Concerning the result obtained with the Kinect, the accuracy percentage is significantly lower.

\section{Improvements}

\subsection{Local Binary Patterns}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\noindent One of the way to improve the LBP operator of this system is to add weights for each of the 42 regions of the face, as seen in Chapter~\ref{chap:lbp}. The LBP operator used in this system is already far from the basic LBP operator; it is a uniform circular LBP operator. Even though the results obtained with this operator are quite good with an accuracy of $ 66.67\% $, there is still room for improvement. Weighting the regions of the face will have an impact on the computed histogram, hence on the resulting feature vector ready for classification. \newline

\noindent The face image is divided in 42 regions ($ 7 $ rows $\times$ $ 6 $ columns), as seen in Chapter~\ref{chap:lbp}, and mentioned in \cite{GAN08}. The weights are however not applied in the same way as in \cite{GAN08}, but rather as in Figure~\ref{lbp_region_weight}. Figure~\ref{implementation_weight_example} shows an example of the division into regions of face images from the KDEF database that this system uses. Thus, border regions are less important than those containing the ROI of the face (eyes, nose, mouth). Figure~\ref{implementation_weight_example} shows an example of the division into regions of face images from the KDEF database used by this system.

\noindent GIVE RESULTS WITH WEIGHTS APPLIED
\newline

\noindent Another way to improve the LBP operator would be to use one with larger scale, hence modify the radius of the circular operator; for example, $ LBP_{12,2.5}^{u^2} $ or $ LBP_{16,4.0}^{u^2} $ (with $ P = 12 $ and $ R = 2.5 $ or with $ P = 16 $ and $ R = 4.0 $). This implies to use the bilinear interpolation because sampling points do not fall exactly on pixels, as seen in Chapter~\ref{chap:lbp}. However, using bilinear interpolation is more computationally expensive. A good compromise has to be found between computation time and accuracy rate.
\newline

\subsection{Combination of feature extraction methods}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\noindent To improve the accuracy of LBP feature extraction method, another feature extraction method can be used and combined with it. 
\newline

\noindent  For example, a method has been proposed by Liao et al. \cite{LIA09}, where they combine LBP and Gabor filter. It is called Dominant Local Binary Patterns (DLBP), and is robust against change of lighting, image rotation and image noise.  It works by using the most recurrent patterns of the LBP method to obtain more information on the texture. It also uses the Gabor method to add global texture information to one already obtained by LBP. It works based on the circularly symmetric Gabor filter responses \cite{LIA09}. Figure~\ref{combination_lbp_gabor} contains two face images of the YaleB face database , and shows the robustness of the combination against change in lighting. Image (a) is the original image with different lighting conditions, and image (b) is the preprocessed image with the Gabor wavelets. Image (c) is the same image, mapped with the LBP operator. Finally, image (d) is the preprocessed image with the combination of the two methods \cite{GOH11}.

\end{figure}

\noindent  LBP has also been combined with the Scale Invariant Feature Transform descriptor (SIFT), which is a ROI descriptor. This descriptor is robust against image rotation, image translations, scaling and lighting variations. Heikkila et al. introduced a combination of the SIFT descriptor with the LBP operator \cite{HEI09}.
