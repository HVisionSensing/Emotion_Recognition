\noindent The computation of the LBP operator takes about 1-4 seconds. It was not expected that it takes so long. it was more expected to obtain a computation time on the order of milliseconds. That is why this Facial Expression Recognition system does not really work in real time an why it needs an interaction with the subject. With the Kinect, 30 frames are received per second. The system should take 33,3 milliseconds maximum ($ \frac{1}{30} = 0,0333 s $) so that it could work in real time.
