\section{Real-time}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\noindent The computation of the LBP operator takes about 1-4 seconds (depending on the computer). It was not expected that it takes so long. it was more expected to obtain a computation time on the order of milliseconds. That is why this Facial Expression Recognition system does not really work in real time an why it needs an interaction with the subject. With the Kinect, 30 frames are received per second. The system should take 33,3 milliseconds maximum ($ \frac{1}{30} = 0,0333 s $) so that it could work in real time and have the time to process each frames. 
\newline

\noindent The system was adapted so that it can still work with video sequences and almost in real time. The subject stands in front of the Kinect and express an emotion among the 6 basic ones plus the neutral one. When the subject thinks that the emotion that is expressed is good, then he can click on the interface to launch the processing with this exact face he made. Then only one frame is used, the one he chose when he clicked. This frame is processed and classified and the output given to the subject is the name of the emotion that he expressed. The output is given about 2 seconds after the subject's click.
