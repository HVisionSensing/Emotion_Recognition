\textit{The main motive of this project is to understand facial expression recognition systems and their applications. A review of the architecture of such systems will be done, along with a state of the art of already existing algorithms. After this study, issues coming along with this kind of recognition system will be studied. In the last part, the requirements of this project will be formulated.}
