}{% the abstract
Since the last decade, a lot of research has been carried out in the area of emotion recognition. The number of projects conducted in this field demonstrates the interest and the importance of systems that can recognize human emotion.


In this project, a facial emotion recognition system is developed, using a Microsoft Kinect as the sensor. This recognition is achieved in three steps: Face detection, facial features extraction and classification. 


Face detection is performed using Viola-Jones' algorithm, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) method is used to extract facial features, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classify these features into six predefined emotions plus the neutral state.


The system is implemented to run on a computer using a Kinect and works for one person in front of it. The classifier is trained with the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces database, which includes a high number of face images to obtain a good result.
