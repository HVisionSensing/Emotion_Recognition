\chapter*{Contents}

\textit{Before getting to the main part of this project that is Feature extraction, there is a mandatory step that is Feature detection. In order to avoid the more computation and processing as possible, only the parts that contains the regions of interest for a Facial Expression Recognition system have to be processed. It means by consequence that there has to be beforehand the detection of the interesting features. This detection can be summarized into face detection. This part will explain how face detection works in general. Then the most famous and efficient algorithm for face detection will be introduced and studied. This algorithm is the Viola-Jones algorithm.}
