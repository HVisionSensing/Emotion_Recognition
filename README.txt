Readme file for the Emotion_Recognition repository

Aalborg University - Department of Electronic Systems
VGIS9 semester project

Theme : Interactive Systems

The aim of this project is to perform real-time facial expression recognition (which can roughly be translated into "emotions").
We will use Local Binary Patterns for feature extraction, and classification will be performed using Support Vector Machines.
We will use a Kinect as video input and several third-party libraries and frameworks (ex.: OpenCV, libsvm) in our project.
